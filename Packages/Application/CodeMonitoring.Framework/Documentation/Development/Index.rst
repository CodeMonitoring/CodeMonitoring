Development
===========

At this very early state everything is one repository, even if multiple packages already exist.
As soon as first packages get a good state and work together, they will be splitted into there own
repositories.

Roadmap
-------

There is no timeline, just the order in which features will, at this moment, be implemented.

#. Implement first example parser and importer, to kick start framework to deal with these tasks and
   provide an example implementation.
   Also provide documentation. After this is implemented, there is already a single standard and
   others can work with imported information.

#. Implement first output based on imported information. Provide first Views and GUI.
